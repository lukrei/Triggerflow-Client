Triggerflow-Client<br>

A Triggerbot for CS2 using memflow.<br>
This is a fork of https://github.com/superyu1337/radarflow2. <br>
Clone the repo on your vm:<br>
git clone https://github.com/lukrei/Triggerflow-Client.git <br>
Then Update Offset:<br>
./update.sh<br>
Compile it again:<br>
./rebuild.sh <br>
Run the program:<br>
./run.sh<br>

Be aware you need a self coded client to receive the udp packets and this can get you vacced because the client relies on the builtin shoot function in cs2. You can find the offsets for shooting via cheat engine. Use it at your own Risk and only on VAC Insecured Servers.
